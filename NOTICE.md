>      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
>      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.

>           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
>           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective

>           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to

>        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
