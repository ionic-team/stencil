# Releasing Stencil

Stencil can either be released by CI/CD (via GitHub Actions), or manually.
An automated release is the preferred way of creating a new release of the project.
Manual releases should only be performed when there are extenuating circumstances preventing an automated release.

## Automated Releases

1. Run the [Stencil Production Release](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/actions/workflows/release-production.yml)
in GitHub
   1. Run the workflow from the `main` branch, _unless_ the release is for a previous major version of Stencil.
   In that scenario, select the `v#-maintenance` branch corresponding to the version of Stencil being released.
   For example, `v3-maintenance` to release a new version of Stencil v3.
   2. Stencil follows semantic versioning. Select the appropriate version from the dropdown for this release.
   3. Stencil should be published under the `latest` tag, _unless_ the release is for a previous major version of
   Stencil.
2. Proceed to the [Follow-Up section](#follow-up-steps) of this document to run manual follow-up tasks.

## Manual Releases

‚ö†Ô∏è Manual releases should only be performed when there are extenuating circumstances that prevent an automated one from occurring ‚ö†Ô∏è

‚úçÔ∏è Authoring permissions are needed for an individual to perform a manual release. If needed, please ping Ionic leadership. ‚úçÔ∏è

1. Run `npm run clean` locally to clear out any cached build artifacts.
2. Run `npm run release.prepare`. This will install dependencies, bundle Stencil, run tests, etc.
3. Check the [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) and make sure it includes all the changes that have landed since the last 
release.
4. Commit the changes - use the commit message '<emoji> v<VERSION>'. e.g. `git commit -m 'ü§¶‚Äç v2.7.0'` (note the emoji is 
used literally, as opposed to ':facepalm:').
5. Run `npm run release`, which will push the commit/tag to GitHub and publish to NPM.
6. Proceed to the [Follow-Up section](#follow-up-steps) of this document to run manual follow-up tasks.

# Follow-Up Steps

The following steps should be always run, regardless of whether an automated or manual release was performed.

1. Publish the release notes in GitHub using GitHub's [release notes form](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/releases/new).
   1. If anyone from the community contributed commit(s) to this release, append the following to the end of the GitHub release notes:
```md
## Thanks

üéâ Thanks <GitHub_Usernames> for their contributions! üéâ
```
2. Navigate to the [Stencil Site](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-site/pulls) repository and merge PRs
   containing documentation that has been approved, but not merged that is related to the release. Such PRs should be
   labelled as `do not merge: waiting for next stencil release`. It's a good idea to review _all_ PRs though, just in
   case.
3. If there are any 'next' branches in GitHub, say for a future major version of Stencil (e.g. `v5.0.0-dev`), now is a
   good time to rebase them against the `main` branch.
4. Perform the following tasks in JIRA:
   1. Mark this version of Stencil as 'released' in JIRA on the 'Releases' page.
   2. Move the task card in this current sprint to the 'Done' swim-lane.
   3. Stub out the next release and task for the release in JIRA.
5. Ensure all GitHub Issues associated with stories/tasks that shipped in this version of Stencil are closed.
