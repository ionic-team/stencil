# docs-readme test app

This directory contains a test application which exercises the `docs-readme`
output target. This provides us with an end-to-end test of this functionality.

## Components

The components in here and what they test!

### `<styleurls-component>`

This tests that the docs from multiple `styleUrls` in the `@Component`
decorator are pulled in to the docs output correctly.
