# WebdriverIO Component Tests

This directory contains a set of Stencil component tests that verify various scenarios where user interaction or rendering of a component is included.

The following scripts are available:

- `npm run build`: builds all components as lazy-bundle
- `npm run wdio`: runs the WebdriverIO tests
- `npm test`: runs the build and wdio script sequentially

You can filter specific scenarios by using the `--spec` parameter, e.g.:

```sh
npm run wdio -- --spec conditional-basic
# runs test/wdio/conditional-basic/cmp.test.tsx
```

To debug a test, it is recommended to start the test in "watch" mode:

```sh
npm run wdio -- --spec conditional-basic --watch
```

This allows to make changes to the test and have it re-run automatically. If you make changes to a test component you have to re-run the build script manually in another terminal window.

## Test Setup

All components have to be compiled into a lazy-loaded Stencil component before executing the WebdriverIO test. WebdriverIO runs a set-up script (see `test/wdio/setup.ts`) to register all compiled custom components and have them available in your test. No additional imports are required.

## Writing Test

To render a given component, use the `render` helper method from `@wdio/browser-runner/stencil`, e.g.:

```tsx
import { render } from '@wdio/browser-runner/stencil';

render({
  template: () => <my-component></my-component>,
});
```

It is advised to use the common `describe`/`it` syntax to structure your test. Hooks like `beforeEach` can be helpful to render the component into the page. A simple example would be:

```tsx
import { h } from '@stencil/core';
import { render } from '@wdio/browser-runner/stencil';
import { $, expect } from '@wdio/globals';

describe('attribute-basic', function () {
  before(async () => {
    render({
      template: () => <attribute-basic-root></attribute-basic-root>,
    });
  });

  it('button click rerenders', async () => {
    await expect($('.single')).toHaveText('single');
    // ...
  });
});
```

## Asynchronous Matcher

It is recommended to use WebdriverIO's async matcher for all state evaluations of your component. It allows WebdriverIO to rerun the expected condition multiple times until it either passes or fails due to a timeout. This prevents race conditions from happening. For example:

```ts
// üëé element could not be rendered at given time nor have the correct text
expect(document.querySelector('.single').textContent).toBe('single');
// üëç allows WebdriverIO to fetch and assert the content of the component until condition is met
await expect($('.single')).toHaveText('single');
```
