# Karma Testing

Karma can be used to test final rendered output on various browsers and operating systems. Use this process to recreate
issues and test/fix them within browsers. Tests are then locked-in and re-validated with 
[BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) on every Github commit against the browsers which Stencil supports
(ie11+).

To run any tests in this directory:
1. `cd` to `test/karma`
2. `npm install`


### Create a test page

1. Create a directory at the root of `test/karma/test-app` (easiest to just copy an existing test directory)
2. `npm start` will fire up a normal Stencil dev-server and browser.
3. In the browser, navigate to your new test, and build it out to recreate an issue.
4. Keep it simple and focused on one thing.


### Create a karma test

1. In the test directory, create `karma.spec.ts`.
2. Review how other tests render and update using `setupDomTests` and `flush`.
3. `npm run karma.prod` will run all the tests.
4. Thanks!
