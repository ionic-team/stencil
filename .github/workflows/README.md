# Stencil Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous integration (CI) is an important aspect of any project, and is used to verify and validate the changes to the
codebase work as intended, to avoid introducing regressions (bugs), and to adhere to coding standards (e.g. formatting
rules). It provides a consistent means of performing a series of checks over the entire codebase on behalf of the team.

This document explains Stencil's CI setup. 

## CI Environment

Stencil's CI system runs on GitHub Actions.
GitHub Actions allow developers to declare a series of _workflows_ to run following an _event_ in the repository, or on
a set schedule.

The workflows that are run as a part of Stencil's CI process are declared as YAML files, and are stored in the same
directory as this file.
Each workflow file is explained in greater depth in the [workflows section](#workflows) of this document.

## Workflows

This section describes each of Stencil's GitHub Actions workflows.
Each of these tasks below are codified as [reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows).

Generally speaking, workflows are designed to be declarative in nature.
As such, this section does not intend to duplicate the details of each workflow, but rather give a high level overview
of each one and mention nuances of each.

### Main (`main.yml`)

The main workflow for Stencil can be found in `main.yml` in this directory.
This workflow is the entrypoint of Stencil's CI system, and initializes every workflow & job that runs.

### Build (`build.yml`)

This workflow is responsible for building Stencil and validating the resultant artifact.

### Format (`format.yml`)

This workflow is responsible for validating that the code adheres to the Stencil team's formatting configuration before
a pull request is merged.

### Dev Release (`release-dev.yml`)

This workflow initiates a developer build of Stencil from the `main` branch.
It is intended to be manually invoked by a member of the Stencil team.

### Nightly Release (`release-nightly.yml`)

This workflow initiates a nightly build of Stencil from the `main` branch.
A nightly build is similar to a 'Dev Release', except that:
- it is run on a set cadence (it is not expectedthat a developer to manually invoke it)
- it is published to the npm registry under the 'nightly' tag

### Test Analysis (`test-analysis.yml`)

This workflow is responsible for running the Stencil analysis testing suite.

### Test End-to-End (`test-e2e.yml`)

This workflow is responsible for running the Stencil end-to-end testing suite.
This suite does _not_ run Stencil's BrowserStack tests.
Those are handled by a [separate workflow](#browserstack-browserstackyml).

### Test Unit (`test-unit.yml`)

This workflow is responsible for running the Stencil unit testing suite.

### Design

#### Overview

Most of the workflows above are contingent on the build finishing (otherwise there would be nothing to run against).
The diagram below displays the dependencies between each workflow.

```mermaid
graph LR;
    build-core-->test-analysis;
    build-core-->test-e2e;
    build-core-->test-unit;
    format;
```

Making each 'task' a reusable workflow allows CI to run more jobs in parallel, improving the throughput of Stencil's CI.
All resusable workflows can be found in the [workflows directory](.).
This is a GitHub Actions convention that cannot be overridden.

#### Running Tests

All test-related jobs require the build to finish first.
Upon successful completion of the build workflow, each test workflow will start.

The test-running workflows have been designed to run in parallel and are configured to run against several operating
systems & versions of node.
For a test workflow that theoretically runs on Ubuntu and Windows operating systems and targets Node v14, v16 and v18, a
single test workflow may spawn several jobs:

```mermaid
graph LR;
    test-analysis-->ubuntu-node14;
    test-analysis-->ubuntu-node16;
    test-analysis-->ubuntu-node18;
    test-analysis-->windows-node14;
    test-analysis-->windows-node16;
    test-analysis-->windows-node18;
```

These 'os-node jobs' (e.g. `ubuntu-node16`) are designed to _not_ prematurely stop their sibling jobs should one of
them fail.
This allows the opportunity for the sibling test jobs to potentially pass, and reduce the number of runners that need to
be spun up again should a developer wish to 're-run failed jobs'.
Should a developer feel that it is more appropriate to re-run all os-node jobs, they may do so using GitHub's 're-run
all jobs' options in the GitHub Actions UI.

#### Concurrency

When a `git push` is made to a branch, Stencil's CI is designed to stop existing job(s) associated with the workflow + 
branch.
A new CI run (of each workflow) will begin upon stopping the existing job(s) using the new `HEAD` of the branch.

### BrowserStack (`browserstack.yml`)

This workflow is used to run a series of integration tests using [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com).
The exact details of which browsers are targeted can be found in the [karma directory](../../test/karma) of the project.

Running this workflow requires a username + access key in order to access BrowserStack.
These credentials are stored as secrets in GitHub.

This workflow differs from most in that it is designed to run on `pull_request_target` triggers.
This allows community provided pull requests to run BrowserStack tests. 

## Repository Configuration

Each of the workflows described in the [workflows section](#workflows) of this document must be configured in the
Stencil GitHub repository to be _required_ to pass in order to land code in the `main` branch.
