# 7. Unit Testing Expectations

Date: 2021-08-06

## Status

proposed

## Context

Our test coverage should help us to identify bugs before those bugs are presented to our customers. 

## Options

1. No tests.
2. Test all code to 100% coverage. 
3. Set an expectation of high coverage or above for code located within the @utils sub-module, covering all exported members. Set an expectation of moderate coverage for code located within other sub-modules, covering as many exported members as possible and to never allow the untested coverage threshold to fall when introducing new code.
