# Releasing Stencil

Stencil can either be released by CI/CD (via GitHub Actions), or manually.
An automated release is the preferred way of creating a new release of the project.
Manual releases should only be performed when there are extenuating circumstances preventing an automated release.

## Automated Releases

1. Call a `code-freeze` in the Stencil team channel
1. Check that [Stencil's Merge
   Queue](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/queue/) is empty (nothing is
   queued for merge).
1. Run the [Stencil Production Release](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/actions/workflows/release-production.yml)
in GitHub
   1. Run the workflow from the `main` branch, _unless_ the release is for a previous major version of Stencil.
   In that scenario, select the `v#-maintenance` branch corresponding to the version of Stencil being released.
   For example, `v3-maintenance` to release a new version of Stencil v3.
   1. Stencil follows semantic versioning. Select the appropriate version from the dropdown for this release.
   1. Stencil should be published under the `latest` tag, _unless_ the release is for a previous major version of
   Stencil.
1. Proceed to the [Follow-Up section](#follow-up-steps) of this document to run manual follow-up tasks.

## Manual Releases

‚ö†Ô∏è Manual releases should only be performed when there are extenuating circumstances that prevent an automated one from occurring ‚ö†Ô∏è

‚úçÔ∏è Authoring permissions are needed for an individual to perform a manual release. If needed, please ping Ionic leadership. ‚úçÔ∏è

1. Call a `code-freeze` in the Stencil team channel
1. Run `npm run clean` locally to clear out any cached build artifacts.
1. Run `npm run release.prepare`. This will install dependencies, bundle Stencil, run tests, etc.
1. Check the [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) and make sure it includes all the changes that have landed since the last 
release.
1. Commit the changes - use the commit message '<emoji> v<VERSION>'. e.g. `git commit -m 'ü§¶‚Äç v2.7.0'` (note the emoji is 
used literally, as opposed to ':facepalm:').
1. Run `npm run release`, which will push the commit/tag to GitHub and publish to NPM.
1. Proceed to the [Follow-Up section](#follow-up-steps) of this document to run manual follow-up tasks.

# Follow-Up Steps

The following steps should be always run, regardless of whether an automated or
manual release was performed.

1. Publish the release notes in GitHub using GitHub's [release notes form](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/releases/new).
   1. If anyone from the community contributed commit(s) to this release,
      append the following to the end of the GitHub release notes:

      ```md
      ## Thanks

      üéâ Thanks <GitHub_Usernames> for their contributions! üéâ
      ```
1. Navigate to the [Stencil Site](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-site/pulls) repository and merge PRs
   containing documentation that has been approved, but not merged that is related to the release. Such PRs should be
   labelled as `do not merge: waiting for next stencil release`. It's a good idea to review _all_ PRs though, just in
   case.
1. If there are any 'next' branches in GitHub, say for a future major version of Stencil (e.g. `v5.0.0-dev`), now is a
   good time to rebase them against the `main` branch.
1. Perform the following tasks in JIRA:
   1. Mark this version of Stencil as 'released' in JIRA on the 'Releases' page.
   1. Move the task card in this current sprint to the 'Done' swim-lane.
   1. Stub out the next release and task for the release in JIRA.
1. Ensure all GitHub Issues associated with stories/tasks that shipped in this version of Stencil are closed.
   1. For each issue, add a comment stating the version of Stencil that
      included the fix/feature (be sure to update the version number _and_
      tag):
      
      ```md
      The fix for this issue has been released as a part of today's [Stencil
      vNUMBER release](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/releases/tag/TAG). 
      ```
1. Let folks in Ionic know about the release in the #whathappened Slack channel
   with a link to the changelog.
1. End the code freeze in the Stencil team Slack channel.
