### Refactor

The test suite now comes with a `TestWindow` class, with the ultimate goal of better simulating a standardized browser environment built on top of `window` and `document`. Using a `TestWindow` instance allows tests to stay compartmentalized, and not require global objects which get reused (which is not ideal for testing). Instead, each test creates a new instance of `window`, and by doing so lets each test to not affect others.

The test suite has been refactored to now use `TestWindow` instead of `render` and `flush`. Existing tests will continue to work, but warnings will be printed to use `TestWindow` instead. Here are [a few examples](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/commit/77dd1c79b4d8926995d9a48773c8516fff63e410).

##### Old test:

```
import { render, flush } from '@stencil/core/testing';
import { MyComponent } from './my-component';

it('should be the old way', async () => {
  const element = await render({
    components: [MyComponent],
    html: '<my-cmp first="Marty" last-name="McFly"></my-cmp>'
  });
  expect(element.textContent).toEqual('Hello, my name is Marty McFly');

  element.first = 'George';
  await flush(element);

  expect(element.textContent).toEqual('Hello, my name is George McFly');
});
```

##### New test:

```
import { TestWindow } from '@stencil/core/testing';
import { MyComponent } from './my-component';

it('should be the new way', async () => {
  const window = new TestWindow();
  const element = await window.load({
    components: [MyComponent],
    html: '<my-cmp first="Marty" last-name="McFly"></my-cmp>'
  });
  expect(element.textContent).toEqual('Hello, my name is Marty McFly');

  element.first = 'George';
  await window.flush();

  expect(element.textContent).toEqual('Hello, my name is George McFly');
});
```

### Bug Fixes

* **events:** fix adding listeners from JSX attributes ([527f2ac](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/commit/527f2ac)), closes [#662](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/662)

## üé∫ [0.7.6](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/compare/v0.7.5...v0.7.6) (2018-03-22)

### Features

Listeners can now be added to specific elements within JSX. [#323](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/323#issuecomment-375349412)

For example, if a component emits the event `ionChange`, then the JSX attribute `onIonChange` can be added, such as:

```
<ion-input onIonChange={(ev) => this.someMethod(ev)}/>
```

This matches how listeners are added for standard events. For example, to listen to a button's `click` event, the JSX attribute would be `onClick`.

### Component CSS and Sass Plugin Update

For external collections that provide both CSS and Sass files, such as [Ionic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ionic/core), if the Stencil project does not have the [@stencil/sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stencil/sass) plugin installed then it'll default to using the collection's CSS build. If project does have the sass plugin installed then it'll rebuild the external collection's sass files at compile time. This allows projects to override a collection's default Sass variables using the plugin's `injectGlobalPaths` option. Please see the [@stencil/sass options](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stencil/sass) for more information.

### Features

* **sass:** move sass to external plugin, [@stencil](https://github.com/stencil)/sass ([371c44c](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/commit/371c44c)), closes [#490](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/490)


#### Collection Imports

The `config.collections` config has been deprecated in favor of standard ES module imports. Instead of listing collections within `stencil.config.js`, collections should now be imported by the app's root component. The benefit of this is to not only simplify the config by using a standards approach for imports, but to also automatically import the collection's types to improve development. If you are using any collections, such as `@ionic/core`, please remove the `config.collections` property entirely from `stencil.config.js`. Next, to include the collection and its types in the project, add the import to your root component. For example:

```
import '@ionic/core';
```


#### Sass moved to `@stencil/sass`

Previously Sass was embedded within `@stencil/core`, and styles with a scss extension were automatically precompiled to CSS. In order to better support all external projects, the plugin system is now apart of the compiler's public API and config. With this update, Sass has been moved out of core and into its own plugin, [@stencil/sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stencil/sass). Additionally, this enables other external projects, such as [@stencil/postcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stencil/postcss). If you are currently using Sass, please run the following:

```
npm run @stencil/sass --save-dev
```

And within `stencil.config.js`, add the plugins config property. For example:

```
const sass = require('@stencil/sass');

exports.config = {
  plugins: [
    sass()
  ]
};
```

(Also note that adding Stylus and Less plugins are on our roadmap.)

<a name="0.4.0-0"></a>
# [0.4.0-0](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0) (2018-02-08)


### Breaking Changes

1. `www` directory is always emptied of all files and directories when a build starts. The `www` directory is now only a distribution directory, and should not be used to for production static source files. If an app has static source files that need to be copied to the `www` directory, please use the `src/assets` directory instead. Files within `src/assets` will automatically get copied to `www/assets` during the build.
2. `config.bundles` is no longer required. However, if the `config.bundles` is left within `stencil.config.js`, and that config didn't correctly have all the app's required components, then some components won't render. It's best to just remove `config.bundles` entirely since `0.4.0`.
3. App's root `tsconfig.json` file is used directly by stencil for further configuration during build. [See PR 451](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/pull/451). There may be settings within an app's existing tsconfig that didn't error out previous, but now would. But this is a good thing.
