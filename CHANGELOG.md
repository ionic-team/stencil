### Stencil Testing Features

Testing within Stencil is now broken up into two distinct types: Unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), and End-to-end tests with [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/). Previous versions already used Jest, but Stencil provided a `TestWindow` and mocked the browser environment using JSDom.

With the latest changes, the browser environment for e2e testing is done using Puppeteer, which provides many advantages Stencil can start to incorporate into its builds later on. This means the previous testing methods using `TestWindow` has been removed in place of Puppeteer's API.

Unit testing is for testing small chunks of code at the lowest level. For example, when a method is given X, it should return Y. Unit tests should not be doing full rendering of the component, but rather focused on logic only. E2E tests would be testing rendering and components working together. For example, when `my-component` has the X attribute, the child component then renders the text Y, and expects to receive the event Z. By using Puppeteer for rendering tests (rather than a Node environment simulating how a browser works), your end-to-end tests are able to run within an actual browser in order to give better results.

Stencil also provides many utility functions to help test Jest and Puppeteer. For example, a component's shadow dom can now be queried and tested with the Stencil utility functions built on top of Puppeteer. Tests can not only be provided mock HTML content, but they can also go to URLs of your app which Puppeteer is able to open up and test on Stencil's dev server.

End-to-end tests require a fresh build, dev-server, and puppeteer browser instance created before the tests can actually run. With the added build complexities, the `stencil test` command is able to organize the build requirements beforehand.

Previously, the `jest` command was directly within an `npm` script, and Jest's config was within the app's `package.json` file. While this is certainly still doable, the `stencil test` command handles the build requirements, keeps configurations centralized in `stencil.config.ts`, and lazily installs Jest and Puppeteer when they're needed for the first time.

With this release, the `jest` config within the app's `package.json` file can be safely removed, and the `npm` `test` script can be set to `stencil test --spec` instead of `jest`. It's also recommended to add an `npm` script `test.e2e` pointing to `stencil test --e2e`. Note that both unit tests and end-to-end tests could be ran with the same command, such as `stencil test --spec --e2e`. Below would be a common setup:

```javascript
"scripts": {
  "test": "stencil test --spec",
  "test.watch": "stencil test --spec --watch",
  "test.e2e": "stencil test --e2e"
}
```

Providing a Jest config is no longer required and Stencil will apply defaults from data it has already gathered. For example, Stencil already knows what directories to look through, and what files are spec and e2e files. Jest can still be configured using the same config names, but now using the stencil config `testing` property. It's also recommended to use the typed version of stencil.config *.ts* so you'll be able to see the typed configs and descriptions.

```javascript
import { Config } from '@stencil/core';

export const config: Config = {
  testing: {
    testPathIgnorePatterns: [...]
  }
};
```


### Example E2E Test

```javascript
import { newE2EPage } from '@stencil/core/testing';

it('should create toggle, unchecked by default', async () => {
  const page = await newE2EPage();

  await page.setContent(`
    <ion-toggle class="pretty-toggle"></ion-toggle>
  `);

  const ionChange = await page.spyOnEvent('ionChange');

  const toggle = await page.find('ion-toggle');

  expect(toggle).toHaveClasses(['pretty-toggle', 'hydrated']);

  expect(toggle).not.toHaveClass('toggle-checked');

  toggle.setProperty('checked', true);

  await page.waitForChanges();

  expect(toggle).toHaveClass('toggle-checked');

  expect(ionChange).toHaveReceivedEventDetail({
    checked: true,
    value: 'on'
  });
});
```


### Async @Method

Stencil's architecture is async at all levels which allows for many performance benefits and ease of use. By ensuring publicly exposed methods using the `@Method` decorator return a promise:

* Developers can call methods before the implementation was downloaded without `componentOnReady()`, which queues the method calls and resolves after the component has finished loading.
* Interaction with the component is the same whether it still needs to be lazy-loaded, or is already fully hydrated.
* By keeping a component's public API async, apps could move the components transparently to web workers and the API would still be the same.
* Returning a promise is only required for publicly exposed methods which have the `@Method` decorator. All other component methods are private to the component and are not required to be async.

Also note, developers should try to rely on publicly exposed methods as little as possible, and instead default to using properties and events as much as possible. As an app scales, we've found it's easier to manage and pass data through `@Prop` rather than public methods.


### defineCustomElements()

Stencil injects `defineCustomElements()` into the generated collections so the generated web components can be easily consumed in projects that use a build system such as Webpack. For example, projects written using Angular or Vue.
We have been working to make it more performant and smaller while still providing transparent lazy loading out of the box.

This releases introduces a subtle change in how this function is exported. Previously it was exported in the main entry-point, but now it lives in its own entry-point. This entry point is called loader by default but that can be modified via the `stencil.config.ts` file.
This change will lead to much better tree-shaking and performance.

```diff
- import { defineCustomElements }  from 'my-collection';
+ import { defineCustomElements }  from 'my-collection/dist/loader';
```

### Functional Component Interface change

This release includes a change to the interface of functional components. This change should make working with components simpler and more predictable.

Previously children were included with props as the first parameter in the components signature.  The change has moved children out into the second parameter.  You can now assume that children is always passed and its value will always be an array.  If there are no children the array lenght will be zero.

```diff
- const Component: FunctionalComponent<PropInterface> = ({ children, ...props}, utils) => {
+ const Component: FunctionalComponent<PropInterface> = (props, children, utils) => {
```

### Bug Fixes

* **types:** Update available config options for nodeResolveConfig to allow for string arrays. ([72dca29](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/commit/72dca29))

**Update stencil.config.js:**

```diff
- const sass = require('sass');
- const postcss = require('@stencil/postcss');
+ const { sass } = require('@stencil/sass');
+ const { postcss } = require('@stencil/postcss');
```

**Or migrate to strong typed configuration:**

- **Step 1:** rename
`stencil.config.js` => `stencil.config.ts`

- **Step 2:** use ES modules instead of commonjs

```ts
import { Config } from '@stencil/core';
import { sass } from '@stencil/sass';
import { postcss } from '@stencil/postcss';
import * as autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer';

export const config: Config = {
  plugins: [
    postcss({
      sass(),
      plugins: [autoprefixer()]
    })
  ]
};
```

> Using **stencil.config.ts** provides many DX improvements such as: autocompletion and documentation built into the IDE and detection of errors at compiler time!

`@stencil/core` now ships with an integrated dev-server which communicates directly with the build process. Stencil's integrated dev-server enables hot module replacement (HMR), which allows components to self-update without requiring a full webpage reload. Additionally, style changes within web components are also able to reload styles without a webpage reload. Other features from the integrated dev-server include build-time error reporting directly within the browser, both as an overlay and within console.logs.

The new `@stencil/core` integrated dev-server is a replacement for the external `@stencil/dev-server` package, but the previous package will continue to work if no changes are made to an app's npm scripts. To start testing out the new dev-server, within the app's `package.json` scripts:

**Update:**

`sd concurrent \"stencil build --dev --watch\" \"stencil-dev-server\"`

**To:**

`stencil build --dev --watch --serve`

Note that the updated command is no longer requiring `sd concurrent`, which is from the `@stencil/utils` package, and no longer requires `stencil-dev-server`, which is from the `@stencil/dev-server` package. Unless the app is using these packages elsewhere, both can
safely be removed as a dependency.

Next, the `stencil.config.js` file can also remove the entire `exports.devServer = {...}` config since it is no longer used.
