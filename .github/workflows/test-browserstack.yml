# this workflow splits running Browserstack tests into two jobs:
# - one to build stencil for Browserstack
# - one to build the test applications & invoke Browserstack
#
# doing so allows us to balance a few different considerations when running against Browserstack:
# 1. Rerunning Failed Jobs
#    Creating a separate job for running Browserstack on its own allows us to 'rerun failed jobs' in the GitHub UI,
#    only for the Browserstack tests themselves.
#    This allows for a quicker feedback loop in the event of flaky jobs
# 2. Secret Security
#    In order to authenticate against Browserstack, an access key and username are required
#    In order to minimize their access/usage elsewhere, we contain them to the workflow that is this file
#
# These items do come at a cost of some repeated steps in the jobs below (checking out code, installing dependencies,
# etc.)

    # The concurrency field allows us to block multiple invocations of this job across multiple workflow runs.
    # Stencil is only able to run 5 parallel tests in Browserstack, which is exceeded when more than one run of this
    # workflow occurs - e.g. more than one pull request is submitted in proximity, a pull request and a merge to a
    # branch that runs this workflow, etc.
    #
    # At this time, Karma is unable to properly wait for the queued Browserstack tests to finish. Instead, use the
    # GitHub Actions 'concurrency' field as means to block the job until no other tests are running.
