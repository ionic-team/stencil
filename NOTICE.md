>      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.

>           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
>           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
