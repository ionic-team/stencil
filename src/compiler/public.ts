 * results, including diagnostics and the transpiled code. The `transpile()` function
 * does not handle any bundling, minifying, or precompiling any CSS preprocessing like
 * Sass or Less. The `transpileSync()` equivalent is available so the same function
 * it can be called synchronously. However, TypeScript must be already loaded within
 * the global for it to work, where as the async `transpile()` function will load
 * TypeScript automatically.
 *
 * Since TypeScript is used, the source code will transpile from TypeScript to JavaScript,
 * and does not require Babel presets. Additionally, the results includes an `imports`
 * array of all the import paths found in the source file. The transpile options can be
 * used to set the `module` format, such as `cjs`, and JavaScript `target` version, such
 * as `es2017`.
