        Thanks for the issue! This issue has been labeled as `needs reproduction`. This label is added to issues that
        need a code reproduction.


        Please reproduce this issue in an Stencil starter component library and provide a way for us to access it
        (GitHub repo, StackBlitz, etc). Without a reliable code reproduction, it is unlikely we will be able to resolve
        the issue, leading to it being closed.


        If you have already provided a code snippet and are seeing this message, it is likely that the code snippet was
        not enough for our team to reproduce the issue.


        For a guide on how to create a good reproduction, see our
        [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
