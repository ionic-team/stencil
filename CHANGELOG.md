### Note

As we’ve made further enhancements to support declarative Shadow DOM, the Stencil team has determined that it’s not feasible to allow users to render a shadow component as a scoped component after compilation, such as by calling `renderToString` with `serializeShadowRoot: false`. This is because Stencil compiles styles for either shadow or scoped mode during the compilation process, embedding these styles into the hydrate module. Once this compilation is complete, the styles cannot be transformed to support the other mode. Recognizing that this change would impact the current functionality, the Stencil team has decided to proceed with this update. Moving forward, we recommend serializing all components marked with shadow: true as declarative Shadow DOM.

## 🎆 [2.22.3](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/compare/v2.22.2...v2.22.3) (2023-03-14)


### Bug Fixes

* **compiler:** use file system polling events in watch mode ([#4147](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/4147)) ([7f3d514](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/commit/7f3d514c5a12e6563e315a834329da40026dd538)), fixes [#3952](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/3952), [#4011](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/4011), [#4044](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/4044)


## 🎈 [2.22.2](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/compare/v2.22.1...v2.22.2) (2023-01-23)


### Bug Fixes

* **runtime:** workaround for performance slowing in Chrome 109 ([#3995](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/3995)) ([6544422](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/commit/65444226303bf2ccb678576b4fb57b4df35e0a18))



## ✈️ [2.22.1](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/compare/v2.21.0...v2.22.1) (2023-01-17)


### Note

v2.22.0 was never published to NPM, nor GitHub. The team had originally intended to release v2.22.0 on 2023.01.17.
However, the publish attempt occurred during an NPM outage (unbeknown to the team). The result of this outage left the
package 'marked' as published, although the publish did not succeed. v2.22.1 is identical to the version that the
Stencil team originally intended to release as v2.22.0.

* **typescript:** add support for typescript 4.9 ([#3863](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/3863)) ([542c46a](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/commit/542c46a94400246f1b995df0840c918e080a9e57))

# 🚗 [2.0.0](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/compare/v1.17.3...v2.0.0) (2020-08-31)

In keeping with [Semver](https://semver.org/), Stencil `2.0.0` was released due to changes in the API (mainly from some updates to the config API).

Even though this is a new major version, there are few [BREAKING CHANGES](BREAKING_CHANGES.md), and any changes will be flagged and described by the compiler during development. For the most part, most of the changes are removal of deprecated APIs that have been printing out warning logs for quite some time now.

### TypeScript 4

- **typescript:** bundle typescript ([1973032](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/commit/197303210e76f048b470d3cf91237b015ce3f116))
- **typescript:** update to typescript 4.0.0-beta ([a274e11](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/commit/a274e1149c2da53b224bfba69e0a798c47920417))
- **typescript:** update to typescript 4.0.1-rc ([def2e6b](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/commit/def2e6b8c926c6b4d79ffcfd9bcb4300f82312fa))
- **typescript:** update to typescript 4.0.2 ([f55f0bf](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/commit/f55f0bf7e331d043dbee990b8bd5b7934cbac92b))

The other change is the update to [TypeScript 4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0/). With Stencil 2, TypeScript will no longer be a `dependency`, but instead included within the Stencil compiler. There are a few advantages to this we'll be experimenting with:

- Faster compiler startup times and overall smaller install size.
- The custom elements build should have a `dependency` of `@stencil/core`, so not having TypeScript as a dependency of `@stencil/core` simplifies the dependency graph for end-users and libraries.
- Drastically simplifies the Stencil compiler by not having to dynamically import TypeScript, which quickly gets complicated since the compiler can work within Node, Deno, web workers and the browser's main thread. By bundling internally many of the complexities are no longer an issue.
- Stencil compiler guaranteed to run with the exact version of TypeScript it was designed with.
- Easier to adjust to breaking changes. For example, TypeScript 4 introduced a few breaking changes, but with this update it made it easier for the compiler to adjust internally.

### Removal of `Context`

The `Context` object was originally added in the `0.x.x` versions of Stencil, before ES Modules were widely adopted. Since then we've deprecated it in Stencil 1, and have ported any external libraries off of it. The remaining one was `@stencil/redux`, and we've released `0.2.0` to be used with Stencil 2 (and can also work with Stencil 1). Additionally, now might be a good time to look into using [@stencil/store](https://stenciljs.com/docs/stencil-store) instead.
