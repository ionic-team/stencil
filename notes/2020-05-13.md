# Stencil Contributors Chat - May 13, 2020

## SSG

* Now documented. Everything is supported and tested out. Also includes types
* Has a separate config file. Helps keep things separate, and is opt-in
* https://stenciljs.com/docs/static-site-generation

## Debugging

* Now possible with a single file, can loaded and testing things out in VS Code

## Bindings

* Plan on moving them into the main Ionic project, make it easier to use. Still opt-in. Ionic will be using it directly soon; Josh gives it double-thumbs-up

## Custom Elements bundle

* Docs written up https://stenciljs.com/docs/custom-elements
* Can be used without lazy loading
* BYO polyfills & IE11 support

## In development

### Store

* In development, used to build out new stuff (like router below)

### Router

* Simpler API. Use it on a side project, looking for feedback

### Forms

* Look at what's good/bad. Modeling off react-formik, but w/o the validation and extra stuff. Simplified boilerplate for forms/inputs
* No-UI provided. Use with or w/o Ionic
## Other stuff

* TypeScript 3.9; easier to bring in a type, but not accidentally bring in other code
* Rollup update to support synthetic exports in CommonJS better. Manu has more details
* Speed up development with experimentalDevModules (load JS modules directly, kind of like Snowpack)
## Q&A

* Questions re: SSG, prerendering, dist-hydrate
* SSG also does script module/preload, might be better
* Question re: ion-router, how to use in a vanilla component vs stencil router
